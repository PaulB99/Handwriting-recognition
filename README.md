# Handwriting-recognition
Simple machine learning using Scikit-Learn to recognise digits, and then seaborn to produce a confusion matrix. Using the mnist database http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Just run each python file to carry out the learning and testing

So far I have implemented K nearest neighbour, Random forest and Linear support vector classification.

I generally consider this project complete
