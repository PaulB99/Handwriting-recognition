# Handwriting-recognition
Simple machine learning using Scikit-Learn to recognise digits. Using the mnist database http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Just run each python file to carry out the learning and testing
So far I have implemented the K nearest neighbour algorithm. I hope to implement more in the future

To add: 
* Random forest
* Linear support vector
* Confusion matrices 
* App?
* Comparison between methods
