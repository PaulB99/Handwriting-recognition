# Handwriting-recognition
Simple machine learning using Scikit-Learn to recognise digits, and then seaborn to produce a confusion matrix. Using the mnist database http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Just run each python file to carry out the learning and testing

So far I have implemented K nearest neighbour, Random forest and Linear support vector classification. I hope to implement more in the future.


To add:  
* App?
* Comparison between methods
* Report on how training sample size affects accuracy in different methods of classification (overfitting)
